<h1 align="center"><u>Bayesian Filtering Classes</u></h1>
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Bayesian Filtering is a probabilistic technique for data fusion.
The technique combines a concise mathematical formulation of a
system, with observations of that system. Probabilities are used to
represent the state of a system, likelihood functions to represent
their relationships. In this form Bayesian inference can be applied
and further related probabilities deduced. See <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a>
for information on <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_theory">Probability
theory</a>, <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes%27_theorem">Bayes
theorem</a>, <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_inference">Bayesian
Inference</a>.</p>
<p>For <u>discrete</u> systems the Bayesian formulation results in a
naturally iterative data fusion solution. For <u>dynamic</u> systems
there is a class of solutions, discrete <u>filters</u>, that combine
observed inputs to the system with the dynamic model. A filter that
iteratively incorporates new information is an <u>estimator</u>. For
linear dynamic systems, discrete solutions such as the Kalman filter
apply.</p>
<h2><a href="Bayes++.html">Bayes++ Overview</a></h2>
<p>The Bayesian filtering classes are implemented as part of Bayes++;
the open source C++ release of the library. These classes represent
and implement a wide variety of numerical algorithms for Bayesian
Filtering of discrete systems. The classes provide tested and
consistent numerical methods and the class hierarchy explicitly
represents the variety of filtering algorithms and system model
types.</p>
<p>The following documentation summaries the classes available and
provides some general comments on their use. Each class's <b>.hpp</b>
file provides a complete interface specification and the numerical
form of the solution. Implementation issues are documented in the
<b>.cpp</b> files.</p>
<h2>Numerical Schemes in Bayes++</h2>
<p>There is a wide range of different numerical techniques for
filtering. For example the Kalman filter (a linear estimator which
calculates the 2<sup>nd</sup> order statistics of the system) is
represented using either a state vector and a covariance matrix, or
alternatively in information form.</p>
<p>Each numerical technique is a <b><i>Scheme</i></b>, and each
Scheme is implemented as a class. Each scheme implements the
algorithms required by a filter's particular numerical form. The
schemes provide a common interface that allows:</p>
<dl><dl><dd><p>i. initialization and update of the state, and</p></dd><dd><p>
		ii. predict and observe functions with parameterized models</p></dd></dl></dl>
<p>
Each Scheme has both advantages and disadvantages. The numerical
complexity and efficiency varies, as does the numerical stability.
The table below lists all Schemes together with any requirement on
the representation associated with the algorithm.</p>

<h1>Three Examples</h1>

<h2>Simple Example (Initialize &#8211; Predict &#8211; Observe)</h2>
<p>This is very simple example for those who have never used the
Bayesian Filtering Classes before. The example shows how two classes
are built. The first is the prediction model, the second the
observation model. In this example they represent a simple linear
problem with only one state variable and constant model noises.</p>
<p>The example then constructs a filter. The <b>Unscented</b> filter
scheme is chosen to illustrate how this works, even on a simple
linear problem. After construction the filter is given the problem&#8217;s
initial conditions. A prediction using the predefine prediction model
is then made. This prediction is then fused with an external
observation given by the example and the defined observation model.
At each stage, the filter&#8217;s state estimate and variance
estimate are printed.</p>
<h2>Position and Velocity</h2>
<p>This example solves a simple position and velocity observation
problem using the Bayesian filter classes. The system has two states,
position and velocity, and a noisy position observation is simulated.
Two variants:</p>
<dl><dl><dd><p>1) direct filter</p></dd><dd><p>
		2) indirect filter where the filter is preformed on error and state
		is estimated indirectly</p></dd></dl></dl>
<p>
are demonstrated using a specified numerical scheme. The example
shows how to build <u>linear</u> prediction and observation models
and to cycle the filter to produce state estimates.</p>
<h2>Quadratic Calibration</h2>
<p>This example implements a &#8220;Quadratic Calibration&#8221;
filter. The observer is trying to estimate the state of a system as
well as the systems scale factor and bias. A simple system is
simulated where the state is affected by a known perturbation.</p>
<p>The example shows how to build <u>linearized</u> prediction and
observation model and cycle a filter to produce state estimates.</p>
<h1>Dual Abstraction</h1>
<p>The aim of Bayes++ is to provide a powerful and extensible
structure for Bayesian filtering. This is achieved by hierarchical
composition of related objects. In C++ these are represented by a
hierarchy of polymorphic classes. Numerical Schemes are grouped by
their state representation. The Schemes themselves provided the
filtering operations on these representations.</p>
<p>To complete a filter, an associated prediction and observation
model must also be specified. These model classes parameterize the
filtering operations. The users responsibility is to chose a model
type and provide the numerical algorithm for that model. Again model
classes composed using a hierarchy of polymorphic abstract classes to
represents the structure of each model type.</p>
<p>This <em>dual abstraction</em>, separating numerical schemes from
model structure, provides a great deal of flexibility. In particular
it allows a well-specified model to be used with a variety of
numerical schemes.</p>

<h1>Capabilities</h1>

<h2>Probabilistic representation of state</h2>
<p>Bayes rule is usually defined in term of Probability Density
Functions. However PDFs never appear in Bayes++. They are always
represented by their statistics.</p>
<p>This is for good reason, there is very little that can be done
algorithmically with a function. However the sufficient statistics,
given the assumptions of a filter, can be easily manipulated to
implement Bayes rule. Each filter class is derived from a base
classes that represent the statistics used. For example the
Kalman_filter and Sample_filter base classes.</p>
<p>It would be possible to use a common abstract base class for that
enforces the implementation of a PDF function; a function that maps
state to probability. This would provide a very weak method to view
the PDF of state. However such a function could not be efficiently
implemented by all schemes. Therefore to enforce this requirement in
the base class would be highly restrictive.</p>
<h2>Linear and Linearized models</h2>
<p>Many of the filters use classical linear estimation techniques,
such as the Kalman filter. To make them useful they are applied in
modified forms to cope with <u>linearized</u> models of some kind.
Commonly a gradient linearized model is used to update uncertainty,
while the state is directly propagated through the non-linear model.
This is the <i>Extended</i> form used by the Extended Kalman Filter.</p>
<p>However, some numerical schemes cannot be modified using the
<i>Extended</i> form. In particular, it is not always possible to use
the extended form with correlated noises. Where this is the case, the
linearized model is used for uncertainty and state.</p>
<p>There are also many Bayesian filters that work with non-Gaussian
noise and non-linear models - such as the <i>SIR_filter</i>. The SIR
scheme has been built so it works with Likelihood model.</p>
<p>The filters support discontinuous models such as those depending
on angles. In this case the model must be specifically formulated to
normalize the states. However, some schemes need to rely on an
additional normalization function. Normalization works well for
functions that are locally continuous after normalization (such as
angles). Non-linear functions that cannot be made into locally
continuous models are not appropriate for linear filters.</p>
<h2>Interface Regularity</h2>
<p>Where possible, the Schemes have been designed to all have the
same interface, providing for easy interchange. However, this is not
possible in all cases as the mathematical methods vary greatly. For
efficiency some schemes also implement additional functions. The
functions can be use to avoid inefficiencies where the general form
is not required.</p>
<p>Scheme class constructors are irregular (their parameter list
varies) and must be used with care. Each numerical scheme has
different requirements, and the representation size needs to be
parameterized. A template class Filter_scheme can be used to provide
a generic constructor interface. It provides provides specialization
for all the Schemes so they can be constructed with a common
parameter list.</p>
<h3>Open interface</h3>
<p>The design of the class hierarchy is deliberately open. Many of
the variables associated with schemes are exposed as <i>public
members</i>. For example the covariance filter&#8217;s innovation
covariance is public. This is to allow efficient algorithms to be
implemented using the classes. In particular it is often the case
that subsequent computations reuse the values that have already been
computed by the numerical schemes. Each scheme defines a <i>public
state representation</i>.</p>
<p>Furthermore many temporaries are <i>protected members</i> to allow
derived classes to modify a scheme without requiring any additional
overhead to allocate its own temporaries.</p>
<p>Open interfaces are potentially hazardous. The danger is that
abuse could result in unnecessary dependencies on particular
implementation characteristics. 
</p>
<h4>Public state representation Initialization and Update</h4>
<p>The two functions <b>init</b> and <b>update</b> are defined in the
filter class hierarchy for classes with names ending <b>_state_filter</b>.
They are very important in allowing the <i>public state
representation</i> to be managed.</p>
<blockquote><p><u>After</u> the public representation of a scheme is
changed (externally) the filter should be <i>initialized</i> with an
<b>init</b> function. The scheme may define additional init functions
that allow it to be initialized from alternative representations.
<b>init()</b> is defined for schemes derived from
<b>Kalman_state_filter</b>.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><u>Before</u> the public representation of a scheme is
used the filter should be <i>updated</i> with an <b>update</b>
function. The scheme may define additional update functions that
allow it to update alternative representations. <b>update()</b> is
defined for schemes derived from <b>Kalman_state_filter</b>.</p></blockquote>
<h4>Sharing schemes state representation</h4>
<p>The filter hierarchy has been specifically designed to allow state
representation to be shared. Schemes state representations are
inherited using one or more <b>_state_filter</b> 's as virtual base
classes. It is therefore possible to combine multiple schemes (using
multiple inheritance) and only a single copy of each state
representation will exist.</p>
<p>The <b>init</b> and <b>update</b> functions should be used to
coordinate between the schemes and state representation. This allows
precise control numerical conversions necessary for different schemes
to share the state.</p>
<h4>Assignment and Copy Construction</h4>
<p>Filter classes can be assigned when they are of the same size. In
cases where the class includes members in addition to the public
representation this is optimized so that only public representation
is assigned. Assignment is equivalent to: <i>update</i>, assignment
of public representation and <i>initialization</i> from the new
state.</p>
<p>Copy Constructors are NOT defined. Generally the classes are
expensive to copy and so copies should be avoided. Instead references
or (smart) pointers should be combined with assignment to create
copies if necessary.</p>
<h4>Changing the state representation size</h4>
<p>The classes assume their state representation is a constant size.
They define their matrix sizes on construction. Matrices (and
vectors!) in public representation <u>should NOT be externally
resized</u>.</p>
<p>Since matrix resizing invariable involves reallocation, it is just
as efficient to create new matrices as to resize them. Also for a
filter scheme to change it size it must recomputed its internal
states. Therefore if the size of filter needs to change, the solution
is to create a new filter. The new filter can then be <i>initialized</i>
from the state of the old filter plus some new states. What you do
with these new states usually influences the state representation you
choose. Generally new states either enter the system with nothing
being know about them (zero information), or extract value being know
(zero covariance).</p>
<h2>Numerical and Exception Guarantees</h2>
<p>It is important to be able to rely on the numerical results of
Bayes++. Generally the Schemes are implemented using the most
numerically stable approach available in the literature. Bayes++
provides its own UdU' factorization functions to factorize PSD
positive (semi)definite matrices. The factorization is numerically
stable, computing and checking the conditioning of matrices.</p>
<p>Exceptions are thrown in the case of numerical failure. They
follow a simple rule:<br><em><strong>Bayes_filter_exception</strong>
is thrown if an algorithm cannot continue or guarantee the numerical
post-conditions of a function</em></p>
<p>The only <em>exception guarantee</em> that Bayes++ makes when
throwing <strong><em>Bayes_filter_exception</em> </strong>from any
function, is that no resources will be leaked. That is the <i>Weak
guarantee</i> as defined by <a href="#Reference">Reference[9]</a>.
Therefore, unless otherwise specified, the numeric value of a class's
public state is <strong>undefined</strong> after this exception is
thrown by a member of a class.</p>
<p>Be aware that numerical post-conditions may be met even with
extreme input values. For example some inputs may result in overflow
of a result. This does not invalidate the post-conditions that the
result is positive. Even some <em>Not a Number</em> values may be
valid. Therefore the results may be computed without exception, but
include <em>NaN</em> or <em>non-number</em> values.</p>
<h3>Using exceptions in filter schemes</h3>
<p>What does this mean when using a filter Scheme? If the Scheme
throws an exception then, unless otherwise specified, the numeric
value of its state is undefined. Therefore you <strong>cannot</strong>
use any function of the filter that has any preconditions on its
numerical state. To continue using a filter either the <em>init</em>()
function should be used (which has no pre-conditions) or the filter
destructed.</p>
<p>Generally to access the public state of a Scheme you must first
call the <em>update</em>() function. If no exception is thrown then
the post-conditions of update are guaranteed. The post-conditions of
<em>update</em>() may include such useful properties as the
covariance matrix is PSD. Many application specific tests may also be
required. Just being PSD doesn't say much about X. It could even have
<em>Infinity</em> values on the diagonal! Conditioning, trace,
determinate, and variance bounds can all be applied at his point. 
</p>
<h1>Polymorphic design</h1>
<p>Why are models and filter Schemes <strong>polymorphic</strong> ?
OR Why are they implemented with virtual functions?</p>
<blockquote><p>One alternative would be to use <strong>generic</strong>
instead of <strong>polymorphic</strong> Schemes. This would implement
Schemes as templates. If the sizes of matrix operations could be
fixed generic models and schemes would directly manipulate matrices
for predefined size.</p></blockquote>
<p>Bayes++ relies on a <strong>dual abstraction</strong>, separating
numerical schemes from model structure. To represent these, a
<strong>polymorphic design </strong>was a very important part of
Bayes++ design. After a fair bit of use I still think it was the
correct one. Why?</p>
<p>A) <em>Usage</em> : There are many (run time) polymorphic things I
really want to do with the library. I want to be able to build
composite filtering algorithms that switch models and schemes at run
time. This requires<u> both</u> polymorphic filters and models <u>and</u>
runtime sizing of matrices.<br>A generic approach, especially one
parametrized on matrix size would not allow this. The code size
produced would also bloat massively. Not even STL parameterizes its
containers template with size!</p>
<p>B) <em>Type safety</em>: There is surprising little orthogonality
in filtering schemes. The numerics often dictate restrictions or
additional functionality. The type hierarchy in Bayes++ provides a
succinct and safe way to enforce much of this structure.<br>In a
Generic approach checking that a particular Scheme models a generic
concept correct would be very difficult to enforce.</p>
<p>C) <em>Compiler problems</em>: Generic programming in C++ has a
nasty syntax, is very slow to compile and pushes the limits of
compiler reliability.</p>
<p>D) <em>Efficiency</em>: The run time overhead of a polymorphic
filter is negligible compared to the matrix algebra required. In fact
using common code may increase efficiency on a many computing
architectures.</p>
<h1 align="left">Matrix Representation</h1>
<p>Bayes++ requires an external library to represent matrices and
vectors, and to support basic linear algebra operations. Bayes++ uses
the <a href="http://www.boost.org/libs/numeric/ublas/doc/index.htm"><b>uBLAS</b></a>
library from <a href="http://www.boost.org/"><b>Boost</b></a> for all
these requirements. It an excellent basic linear algebra library. The
interface and syntax are easy to use.</p>
<p>Previous versions of the filters were implemented with the <a href="http://www.osl.iu.edu/research/mtl/" target="_top">Matrix
Template Library</a>, <i>MPP</i> and <i>TNT</i>. Public releases
using MTL are still available. 
</p>
<p>The Bayes++ implementation uses a set of adapter classes in the
namespace <i>Bayesian_filter_matrix</i> (FM for short) for matrix
access. This system should make it simpler to port the library to
other matrix types. For uBLAS these function generally have no
runtime overhead. This efficiency is due to uBLAS's excellent
expression template implementation. For MTL most functions are
reasonably efficient but some functions create matrix temporaries to
return values.</p>
<h2>Matrix library efficiency - Temporary object usage</h2>
<p>Most of the filters avoid using Matrix and Vector temporaries.
They also have optimizations for a constant (on construction) state
size, noise and observations. In particularly the UD_filter scheme
avoids creating any temporary objects. All matrices maintain a fixed
size, other then when the observation state size is varied.</p>
<p>Why are temporary matrix objects bad? The main difficulty is
construction and destruction of Matrices. This generally requires
dynamic memory allocation which is very slow. For small matrices this
dominates compared to the cost of simple operations such as addition
and multiplication.</p>
<p>There are three ways out of this problem.</p>
<blockquote><p>1. Use fixed size matrices; they can (nearly) always
be efficiently allocated on the stack.<br>2. Use stack based dynamic
allocators (such as C99's dynamic arrays or alloca) for
temporaries.<br>3. Don't create temporaries. This is achievable with
a combination of hard coding in the algorithms (pre-allocation) and
by using a Matrix library with expression templates to avoid creating
temporaries for return values.</p></blockquote>
<p>Bayes++ is implemented to avoid creating temporaries. At present
my solution is somewhat of a compromise. MTL is only moderately
efficient on most C++ compilers. On release code this results in a
50% performance reduction if temporaries are avoided. uBLAS attains
close to optimal efficiency in many situations.</p>
<p>The UD_filter is a good illustration. It has been hand crafted to
avoid construction of any temporaries (I use it for embedding) and
can be compiled with either uBLAS, MTL or a special fast matrix
library. UD_filter is heavily optimized to use row operations to
avoid indexing overheads. uBLAS and the special library achieve
comparable results, which I believe are as fast as can be achieved.</p>
<p>On the flip side, the current Unscented_filter implementation
shows some of the problems. Because of my wrapper classes Row/Column
of a 2D matrix are not compatible with the Vec type. This results in
a lot of unnecessary copying into pre-allocated temporary vectors.</p>
<p>Future work includes a general method of avoiding implementation
temporaries. Filter schemes will be parameterised with helper objects
that deal with all the temporaries required. These helper objects can
then hide all the hard work of pre-allocation or dynamic allocation
of temporary objects.</p>
<h1>Restrictions</h1>
<p>For numerical precision, all filter calculations use <b>doubles</b>.
Templates could be used o provide numerical type parameterization but
are not. However the base class <i>Bayes_filter</i> defines <i>Float</i>,
which is used throughout as the numerical type.</p>
<p>The <i>Bayes_filter</i> base class is constructed with constant
state size. This allows efficient use of the matrix library to
implement the algorithms. Each derived class requires additional
representation and matrix temporaries and where possible they are
restricted to a constant size. In general, the only unknown is the
size of the observation state as parameterized by the observation
model.</p>
<p>Where the state size varies efficient solutions are still possible
using either spares matrix representations or by recreating new
filters with increased size.</p>
<h1>The future</h1>
<p>The Bayesian Filtering Classes are now a stable set of solution
for the majority of linear, linearisable and non-linear filtering
problems. I am very happy with their form and function. In
particular, the two-layer abstraction works extremely well. The
classes show best practice in both their design and in efficiency and
numerical stability of the algorithms used. So where to go from here?</p>
<p>The basic tenant of Bayesian theory is that the Likelihood
function complete captures all that is know to update the state. The
Bayesian Filtering classes now allow the modeling systems using
Likelihood functions. At present the SIR filter is the only
Likelihood filter. Sample filters will grow into a separate branch in
the class hierarchy. A general set of adapters will be required to
move between these varied representations.</p>
<p>To further improve the abstraction, the method of internal
variable exposure needs to be regularized. This will require the
addition of a few classes that hold and limit access to filters
internal variables.</p>
<p>The ordering of parameters used in Scheme class constructors is
prone to error. It requires the parameter list to be varied for each
scheme used. An extensible method of model parameterization is
required. A common parameterization could then be used with scheme
constructor extracting the information they require.</p>
<h2>STATE ABSTRACTION</h2>
<p>Can the state representation be abstracted away from the numerics
of a filter Scheme?</p>
<p>At the moment Bayes++ filter Schemes are a combination of the
numerical solution (e.g. innovation update) AND the representation
(e.g. Covariance matrix). Can these two functions be separated?</p>
<p>A highly sophisticated solution could use polymorphic (or generic)
filter algorithms that depend on the type (or traits) of the
representation. I think this in unnecessarily complex. In Bayes++ a
Scheme should only implement one algorithm.</p>
<p>The problem I would like to address is a bit more limited. A lot
of representations are naturally hierarchical and dynamic.<br>e.g.
state := vehicle states &amp; feature states, feature states :=
{feature1 state &amp; feature2 state ....}</p>
<p>There would seem to be too possible ways to solve this</p>
<p>A) HARD: Use a state representation that represents this kind of
hierarchy. The filter schemes could therefore use hierarchical
numerical solutions that exploit the properties of the hierarchical
state.</p>
<p>B) EASY: Allow a sparse matrix representation of state. If the
sparse representation is a Graph then the sort of augmented state
representation in the example can be easily built without any copy
overhead. Each scheme would then just use sparse matrix techniques in
its numerical solution. Mostly what is needed is Cholesky and QR
decomposition and these have good sparse solutions. Obviously there
would be a runtime overhead for this but it would be great for
Simultaneous Location and Mapping problems!</p>
