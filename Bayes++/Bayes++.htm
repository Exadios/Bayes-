<p>Bayesian Filtering is a probabilistic technique for data fusion. The technique
 			results from using a concise mathematical formulation of the state of
a system.  			Probabilities are used to represent states, likelihood functions
to represent  			their relationships. In this form Bayes rule can be applied
and further related  			probabilities deduced.</p>
 		
<p>The Bayesian formulation results in a naturally iterative solution to
data  			fusion and particularly to filtering problems. For linear dynamic
systems,  			discrete solutions such as the Kalman filter apply.</p>
 		
<p>Bayes++ is a library of C++ classes. These classes represent and implement
a  			wide variety of numerical estimation algorithms for Bayesian Filtering.
The  			classes provide tested and consistent numerical methods and the class
hierarchy  			explicitly represents the variety of filtering algorithms and
model types.</p>
 		
<h2>Simple Example</h2>
 		
<p>This is very simple example; for those who have never used the Bayesian
 			Filtering Classes before. If you wish, <a href="simpleExample.cpp"> 				<span
 style="font-family: Verdana;">View the Source</span></a> online. 		</p>
 		
<p>The example shows how two classes are built. The first is the prediction
model,  			the second the observation model. In this example they represent
a simple  			linear problem with only one state variable and constant model
noises.</p>
 		
<h2> 		</h2>
 		
<h2>Compiling the Examples</h2>
 		
<p>First <a href="Bayes++.htm">download</a> and extract Bayes++. If you  			also&nbsp;wish
to compile the PV and Quadratic Calib example or use uBLAS then <em>Boost</em> 
			is also required. <em>Boost</em> can be placed anywhere relative to Bayes++,
 			but it is easy&nbsp;if you&nbsp;follow this&nbsp;structure:</p>

<p dir="ltr">With&nbsp;VC 6 compile the&nbsp;examples&nbsp;using the workspace

<p dir="ltr">The compiler options must be set so the additional <em>Boost</em>

<h2>FAQ</h2>
 		
<h4>Does Bayes++ do Kalman Filtering?</h4>
 		
<p>Yes, there are many implementations in Bayes++. The standard Kalman Filter
or  			Extended Kalman Filter is implemented by the <em>Covariance_filter</em>
Scheme.</p>
 		
<h4>How fast is Bayes++?</h4>
 		
<p>Pretty quick! Depends on the filter Scheme used.</p>
 		
<h4>Why should I use Bayes++? After all, writting a Kalman filter in Matlab
is not  			too hard.</h4>
 		
<p>For a simple test this may be true. If you have ever tried to deal with
the wide  			variety of numerical failures and normalisations required to
deal with  			discontinues model you will realises that is more to implementing
a Kalman  			filter then a hand full of linear algebra equations!</p>
 		
<p>Many DIY Kalman filter implementations fail as they do not maintain the
symmetry  			of matrices. If this is problem is corrected, they usually use
numerically  			inaccurate algorithms and also will silently continue to
operate even when the  			results no longer make sense. The matrices are
ill conditioned! All these hard  			problems have been solved for you by
Bayes++.</p>
 		
<p>However Bayes++ most powerful feature is <strong>not</strong> that it
just does  			things correctly? It provides a consistent methodology to apply
multiple  			Bayesian filtering techniques. Once you have codified the models
that represent  			a problem you can solve your problem with many difference
Bayesian filtering  			techniques. These may be simple Kalman filters such
as the <em>Information_filter</em> 			Scheme, or even a particle filter such
as the <em>SIR_filter</em> Scheme.</p>
 		
<h4>Is Bayes++ stable?</h4>
 		
<p>Although many things have been added to Bayes++ over the last two years
they  			have only added to the variety of implementations. Bayes++'s interface
has now  			reached a very mature stage with little or no change required
to add new types  			of Bayesian filtering.</p>
 		
<p>The implementations of filtering Schemes, included in the web release,
have all  			been tested with a range angle observation problem. I also use
the filtering  			Schemes for my own work, and others do so in the ACFR.
Be aware however that  			the implementation of the Matrix library functions
may change in the future.</p>
 		
<h4>Do I need to program in C++ to use Bayes++?</h4>
 		
<p>Yes! Bayes++ was developed to provide the maximum functionality in C++.
A good  			C++ text book&nbsp;will help you understand how Bayes++ works.&nbsp;&nbsp;There
 			is no need to learn C programming first. Learning C is not a good introduction
 			to modern C++&nbsp;programming techniques used in Bayes++. I would recommend
 			Deitel and Deitel, &#8220;C++: How to Program&#8221;, Second Edition, Prentice Hall,
ISBN  			0-13-528910-6. It is an excellent beginners book; and includes many
useful tips  			and a 			<span lang="en-US">thorough </span>understanding
of the langauge.</p>
 		
<h4>What Matrix library do you recommend?</h4>
 		
<p>From the June 2002 release Bayes++ supports both <a
 href="http://www.genesys-e.org/ublas/index.htm"> 				uBLAS</a> and <a
 href="http://www.osl.iu.edu/research/mtl/">MTL</a>. In  			fact the release
now includes a uBLAS folder with the complete source. The more  			I use
uBLAS the more I like it! The&nbsp;included version 			<span
 style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">incorporates  </span>a
 			few&nbsp;changes required for Bayes++. At present I am working with the
uBLAS  			authors so these will not be required in the future. By changing
the compiler  			include paths a standard version of uBLAS can be used.</p>
 		
<p> 			Credit&nbsp;for everything in&nbsp;the uBLAS folder goes to&nbsp;Joerg
Walter  			and Mathias Koch. uBLAS is a 			<span
 style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">excellent  </span>library.&nbsp;Using
 			it&nbsp;with Bayes++,&nbsp;really shows its 			<span
 style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">excellent  </span> 
			design and efficient implementation. Many thanks!</p>
 		 		
<h2><a name="whatsnew"></a>Whats new?</h2>
 		
<h4>Experimental uBLAS ONLY Release</h4>
 		
<p>To make more efficient use of uBLAS the July 2002 release supports it
 			exclusivly. The change reflects my wish to change Bayes++ matrix  			syntax
to more closely reflect that of uBLAS. There are a few simple  			changes
to note, including:</p>
 		
<ol>
 			<li> 				nrows() and ncols() are now size1() and size2()</li>
 			<li> 				set(X, 0.) should be replaced by X.clear()</li>
 			<li> 				The operator* overloading is dropped. Use the explict X = prod(A,B)<br>
 				In the future uBLAS will introduce a form of prod that reduces the expression
 				complexity by introducing a temporary. This will be probably look like
    <i>prod&lt;type&gt;(A,B)</i>&nbsp;where the type is used to hold&nbsp;the
temporary.</li>
 			<li> 				Look out for the use of X.assign(EE). This is an optimised assignment
when the  				expression EE is independant of X</li>
</ol>
