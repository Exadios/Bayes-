		<p>Bayesian Filtering is a probabilistic technique for data fusion. The technique 
			results from using a concise mathematical formulation of the state of a system. 
			Probabilities are used to represent states, likelihood functions to represent 
			their relationships. In this form Bayes rule can be applied and further related 
			probabilities deduced.</p>
		<p>The Bayesian formulation results in a naturally iterative solution to data 
			fusion and particularly to filtering problems. For linear dynamic systems, 
			discrete solutions such as the Kalman filter apply.</p>
		<p>Bayes++ is a library of C++ classes. These classes represent and implement a 
			wide variety of numerical estimation algorithms for Bayesian Filtering. The 
			classes provide tested and consistent numerical methods and the class hierarchy 
			explicitly represents the variety of filtering algorithms and model types.</p>
		<h2>Simple Example</h2>
		<p>This is very simple example; for those who have never used the Bayesian 
			Filtering Classes before. If you wish, <a href="simpleExample.cpp">
				<span style="FONT-FAMILY: Verdana">View the Source</span></a> online.
		</p>
		<p>The example shows how two classes are built. The first is the prediction model, 
			the second the observation model. In this example they represent a simple 
			linear problem with only one state variable and constant model noises.</p>

		<h2>Compiling the Examples</h2>
		<p>First <a href="Bayes++.htm">download</a> and extract Bayes++. If you 
			also&nbsp;wish to compile the PV and Quadratic Calib example or use uBLAS then <em>Boost</em>
			is also required. <em>Boost</em> can be placed anywhere relative to Bayes++, 
			but it is easy&nbsp;if you&nbsp;follow this&nbsp;structure:</p>

		<p dir="ltr">With&nbsp;VC 6 compile the&nbsp;examples&nbsp;using the workspace <strong>Bayes++.dsw</strong>

			regarding access to source code control. Once you have ignored these once your

		<p dir="ltr">The compiler options must be set so the additional <em>Boost</em> include 
			files can be found. In this case the <u>include path</u> must contain the base 
			directory of Boost. That is <strong>sourceDirectory/boost_1_28_0. </strong>In 
			Visual C++ you should do this by using <em>Tools/Options/Directories</em> for 
			VC6 or&nbsp; <em>Tools/Options/Projects/VC++ Directories</em> for VC7.

		<h2>FAQ</h2>
		<h4>Does Bayes++ do Kalman Filtering?</h4>
		<p>Yes, there are many implementations in Bayes++. The standard Kalman Filter or 
			Extended Kalman Filter is implemented by the <em>Covariance_filter</em> Scheme.</p>
		<h4>How fast is Bayes++?</h4>
		<p>Pretty quick! Depends on the filter Scheme used.</p>
		<h4>Why should I use Bayes++? After all, writting a Kalman filter in Matlab is not 
			too hard.</h4>
		<p>For a simple test this may be true. If you have ever tried to deal with the wide 
			variety of numerical failures and normalisations required to deal with 
			discontinues model you will realises that is more to implementing a Kalman 
			filter then a hand full of linear algebra equations!</p>
		<p>Many DIY Kalman filter implementations fail as they do not maintain the symmetry 
			of matrices. If this is problem is corrected, they usually use numerically 
			inaccurate algorithms and also will silently continue to operate even when the 
			results no longer make sense. The matrices are ill conditioned! All these hard 
			problems have been solved for you by Bayes++.</p>
		<p>However Bayes++ most powerful feature is <strong>not</strong> that it just does 
			things correctly? It provides a consistent methodology to apply multiple 
			Bayesian filtering techniques. Once you have codified the models that represent 
			a problem you can solve your problem with many difference Bayesian filtering 
			techniques. These may be simple Kalman filters such as the <em>Information_filter</em>
			Scheme, or even a particle filter such as the <em>SIR_filter</em> Scheme.</p>
		<h4>Is Bayes++ stable?</h4>
		<p>Although many things have been added to Bayes++ over the last two years they 
			have only added to the variety of implementations. Bayes++'s interface has now 
			reached a very mature stage with little or no change required to add new types 
			of Bayesian filtering.</p>
		<p>The implementations of filtering Schemes, included in the web release, have all 
			been tested with a range angle observation problem. I also use the filtering 
			Schemes for my own work, and others do so in the ACFR. Be aware however that 
			the implementation of the Matrix library functions may change in the future.</p>
		<h4>Do I need to program in C++ to use Bayes++?</h4>
		<p>Yes! Bayes++ was developed to provide the maximum functionality in C++. A good 
			C++ text book&nbsp;will help you understand how Bayes++ works.&nbsp;&nbsp;There 
			is no need to learn C programming first. Learning C is not a good introduction 
			to modern C++&nbsp;programming techniques used in Bayes++. I would recommend 
			Deitel and Deitel, “C++: How to Program”, Second Edition, Prentice Hall, ISBN 
			0-13-528910-6. It is an excellent beginners book; and includes many useful tips 
			and a
			<span lang="en-US">thorough </span>understanding of the langauge.</p>
		<h4>What Matrix library do you recommend?</h4>
		<p>From the June 2002 release Bayes++ supports both <a href="http://www.genesys-e.org/ublas/index.htm">
				uBLAS</a> and <a href="http://www.osl.iu.edu/research/mtl/">MTL</a>. In 
			fact the release now includes a uBLAS folder with the complete source. The more 
			I use uBLAS the more I like it! The&nbsp;included version
			<span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'">incorporates  </span>a 
			few&nbsp;changes required for Bayes++. At present I am working with the uBLAS 
			authors so these will not be required in the future. By changing the compiler 
			include paths a standard version of uBLAS can be used.</p>
		<p>
			Credit&nbsp;for everything in&nbsp;the uBLAS folder goes to&nbsp;Joerg Walter 
			and Mathias Koch. uBLAS is a
			<span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'">excellent  </span>library.&nbsp;Using 
			it&nbsp;with Bayes++,&nbsp;really shows its
			<span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'">excellent  </span>
			design and efficient implementation. Many thanks!</p>
		<h2><a name="whatsnew"></a>Whats new?</h2>
		<h4>Experimental uBLAS ONLY Release</h4>
		<p>To make more efficient use of uBLAS the July 2002 release supports it 
			exclusivly. The change reflects my wish to change Bayes++ matrix syntax to more 
			closely reflect that of uBLAS. There are a few simple changes to note, 
			including:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
			nrows() and ncols() are now size1() and size2()
			<li>
			set(X, 0.) should be replaced by X.clear()
			<li>
				The operator* overloading is dropped. Use the explict X = prod(A,B)<br>
				In the future uBLAS will introduce a form of prod that reduces the expression 
				complexity by introducing a temporary. This will be probably look like <i>prod&lt;type&gt;(A,B)</i>&nbsp;where 
			the type is used to hold&nbsp;the temporary.
			<li>
				Look out for the use of X.assign(EE). This is an optimised assignment when the 
				expression EE is independant of X</li>
		</ol>
