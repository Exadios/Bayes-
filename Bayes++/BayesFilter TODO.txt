BayesFilter TODO List

TODO
	Sharing state in filters: Provided constructors with state references
	observe_model structure changed
		Extened_filter observe_innovation parametrs is only Linear part of model
	replace General_ with a form that works with functional forms
	generalise Sampling infrastructure in SIR

	infRoot: Use seperate G and q predict, check linrz form
	split bayesFlt.h: (predict.h+observe.h)bayesFlt.h
	add a common base of h() in observe
	In MTL can OneDRef be made consistent with a Vec (probably problem due to index form i[index], *i works better
	add a polymorphic observe s,S extraction mechanism

NEW FILTERS
	Factorised UKF or DDF2
	VSDF (factorised from) from Matt Deans
	SIR with Auxilary variables
	Sparse matrix implementations

TO REVIEW
	Allow sub models of smaller dimensions then representation? Causes problems for multiply conformance
	Check consistency of model to filter
		Validate (z to h.Z) model sizes in predict and observe
	UDpredict catching Negative matrices in observe
	filter assert_isPSD may catch NaN faults caused by NaN in model
	Check normalisation
	Check when numerics fail for both state and obs semidefinate
	Check consitent zeroing of unintisalised variables

ISSUES
	Enable Cov and Inf implmentations for PSD matricies where numerically possible. At present may be PD only
	Should UdUrcond at least check U values are numeric values (maybe we need a UdUisPSD)
	NaN in Information_Joseph are different when run under debugger or release in VC6!!!

CODE RULES
	filter
		copy assigment, optimised to remove temps
	predict/observe
		in BayesFlt.h	must be virtual. The types are polymorphic
		in xxFlt.h		no vitual. These are specialised forms
	filter_matrix
		use Vec/Matrix x = a*b; where possible it has no copy overhead
DOCUMENTATION
	Describe generic schemes
